Finding a more efficient trading strategy has always been one of the main concerns in financial market trading. In order to create trading strategies that lead to higher profits, historical data must be used. Due to a large amount of financial data and various factors affecting them, algorithmic trading and, more recently, artificial intelligence are employed to overcome the decision-making complexity. This paper aims to introduce a new approach using Twin-Delayed DDPG (TD3) and the daily close price to create a trading strategy. As a continuous action space deep reinforcement learning algorithm, in contrast to the discrete ones, the TD3 provides us with both the number of trading shares and the trading positions. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the comparison results of our approach and other commonly-used algorithms such as technical analysis, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, stochastic strategies, and deterministic strategies are reported. By employing both position and the number of trading shares, we show that the performance of a trading strategy can be improved in terms of Return and Sharpe ratio.
