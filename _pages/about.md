I am currently employed at LiveTSE, where I have been working on the development of an automated technical trading system for the Tehran Stock Market. I hold a Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering - Communication Systems from Sharif University of Technology, where my thesis focused on "Algorithmic Trading Using Deep Reinforcement Learning" under the supervision of Professor Farokh Marvasti. I also received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Isfahan University of Technology in 2019.

I have a strong academic background and experience in managing electrical and computer engineering projects, with a focus on solving mathematical and engineering problems using Deep Reinforcement Learning. My research interests include Machine/Deep Reinforcement Learning, Medical Image Analysis, Communication Systems, Digital Signal Processing, Causal Inference, Computer Vision, and Bioinformatics. I am also proficient in several programming languages, including Python, MATLAB, Mathcad, and C.
