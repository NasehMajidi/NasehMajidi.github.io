I am currently employed at LiveTSE, where I have been working on the development of an automated technical trading system for the Tehran Stock Market. Furthermore, I have a strong academic background and experience in managing electrical and computer engineering projects, with a focus on solving mathematical and engineering problems using Deep Reinforcement Learning. My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in signal processing, image processing, bioinformatics, and communications. I am also proficient in several programming languages, including Python, MATLAB, Mathcad, and C.
