In code division multiple access (CDMA) communication systems, interference is a significant challenge that must be addressed. Many algorithms have been developed to mitigate this interference, such as iterative techniques and parallel interference cancellation (PIC). Iterative methods have been shown to achieve better results than PIC. To accelerate convergence, Chebyshev acceleration (CA) can be combined with an iterative method.

To prepare a signal for transmission in CDMA, it is multiplied by a signal code. Gold code and optical orthogonal code (OOC) are standard codes for wireless and optical applications, respectively. In our simulations, we also use random code to demonstrate that standard codes result in superior performance (lower bit error rate)
