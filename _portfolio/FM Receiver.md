First, accurate data is received from the RTL-SDR. Next, we developed an FM demodulator using MATLAB code. Additionally, we created low-pass and band-pass filters in MATLAB using Fdatool, as these are also required for this application. It is important to note that the design of precise filters is crucial to this application's success.
