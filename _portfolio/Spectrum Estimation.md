One challenge in spectrum estimation is that we may not have access to all of the signal samples. In this project, we first generated a random signal and then used only a subset of its samples to estimate its spectrum using the ARMA approach in MATLAB. Finally, we compared the estimated spectrum to the true spectrum, which was obtained by squaring the absolute value of the signal's FFT.
