In contrast to vector quantization, scalar quantization is an algorithm whose input is a scalar value, and each quantizer codeword represents a single sample of the source output. We encode sequences of samples in the lossy compression framework to improve encoding efficiency, and we also apply this approach in quantization (as a lossy compression). so, Instead of using individual samples, we use a codeword of length L to quantize a sequence of samples in vector quantization.
